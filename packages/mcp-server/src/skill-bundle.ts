1. Call list_tabs once. If it returns pairing_required, show pair_url and wait for the user to approve.
2. After approval, call pairing_status. Do not retry list_tabs while status is unchanged.
3. Call list_tabs when connected, choose a tab, then open_session with its tab_id.
4. For interaction use browser_getPageInfo then browser_takeSnapshot; for broad reading use browser_createPageIndex.
5. Prefer purpose-built tools and verified results. Use browser_discoverTools only for capabilities outside the connected core surface.
6. Close the session when finished.

  pairing: `# AtWebPilot pairing

list_tabs and pairing_status never wait for browser authorization. A pairing_required result includes pair_url. Show that URL once and wait for the user to approve in the browser. Then call pairing_status; only call list_tabs after it reports connected. Never poll list_tabs or inspect the pair-page HTML.
`,
  reading: `# AtWebPilot reading

Call browser_getPageInfo first. For articles, products, tables, and forms, use browser_createPageIndex, then browser_extractPageFields or browser_searchPageIndex, and read only the relevant block with browser_readPageBlock. Avoid browser_extractText on body and full-DOM reads. Use targeted screenshots only when visual evidence matters.
`,
  interaction: `# AtWebPilot interaction

Refresh browser_takeSnapshot before each major action. Prefer uid-based browser_clickByUid/browser_fillByUid, and use browser_fillForm for independent fields. Use condition-based browser_waitFor rather than fixed delays. Keep submit, upload, storage, and credentialed network actions as explicit reviewed steps.
`,
  visual: `# AtWebPilot visual validation

Use browser_resize and trust its actualViewport/verified result. Capture one browser_screenshot after the page settles; target a selector or page-index block and lower scale when detail permits. Do not follow browser_resize or browser_screenshot with browser_runJS that only re-reads viewport dimensions.
`,
  debugging: `# AtWebPilot debugging

Read browser_consoleMessages first, then browser_networkRequests summaries. Arm recorder bodies only when needed, reproduce once, and fetch one browser_networkRequestDetail. Poll incrementally with sinceId. Check backend and degradedReason before treating missing events as proof.
